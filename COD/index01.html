						<div class="gap41">
							<p> 41 A take on Search & Destroy, but rather than having a single life per round, in Search & Rescue a player's team can revive them. It combines that teamwork and communication from Kill Confirmed with the objective-based cooperation of Search & Destroy.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap42">
							<p>42 Similar to versions in previous games, the player starts with a pistol and continues to gain a new weapon for each player they kill. The match ends when a player cycles through all of the available weapons.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap43">
							<p>43 In this team-based game mode, the first team to earn 100 kills wins. Once a player kills an enemy, becoming "Cranked," the player who earned the kill has 30 seconds to earn a subsequent kill. If they do not earn a subsequent kill within 30 seconds they blow up. It does not appear that the detonation harms nearby teammates or enemies. If a player earns a subsequent kill within 30 seconds the timer resets to 30 seconds. Once a player is "Cranked" their movement speed is increased, they throw grenades more rapidly, and they aim down sight more quickly, among other effects.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap44">
							<p>44 The classic gamemode from previous installments in the franchise returns, in which players must rack up a total of 30 kills to win the game against seven other opponents or rack up to most kills in a 10 minute time limit.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap45">
							<p>45 Team Deathmatch returns in Call of Duty: Ghosts: two teams, 10 minutes, 75 kill limit.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap46">
							<p>46 A gamemode in which one side has five minutes to plant a bomb at a choice of two sites and the other team is tasked with defending the sites, the catch of this mode is there are no respawns and the game ends once one team wins four rounds.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap47">
							<p>47 A gamemode where three flags are scattered throughout the map for players to take and control. Every five seconds a flag in controlled will gain a player's team a point, if a player's team controls two or three flags they gain two or three points. The first team to 200 points wins.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap48">
							<p>48 A gamemode in which two teams battle, similar to TDM, with the catch being that when a player kills an enemy they drop a dog tag, which is worth points when collected. If a player collects a fallen teammate's dog tag, no points are award to the enemy team; first team to 100 points wins the game.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap49">
							<p>49 Similar to the Modern Warfare 3 infected, one player is randomly infected at the beginning and can infect other players until either all survivors are infected or time runs out. Playlists will rotate between several different scenarios involving various loadouts. This mode allows up to 18 players on Xbox One, PS4, and PC versions and up to 12 players on the other platforms.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap410">
							<p>410 This team-based game mode is similar to Capture the Flag in that the player needs to go to a portal located at the enemy's spawn point while preventing players from the enemy team from reaching theirs. These portals are temporarily closed for 10 seconds when they are captured to prevent players from rushing.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap411">
							<p>411 Players start with a pistol, two throwing knives, and a flashbang. Crates are dropped in random locations throughout the match that contains more weapons and ammo for the players to compete for. The game mode has a 25 kill limit.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap412">
							<p>412 Containing a rotating playlist with Domination and Team Deathmatch, but with 12-18 players and a 100 kill limit for TDM. This mode is only available for the Xbox One, PS4, and PC versions of the game.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="gap413">
							<p>413 Teams take turns capturing drop zones for points.</p>
						</div>
